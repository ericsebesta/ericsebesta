### Professional Profile

This is my personal GitHub account, and is not associated with Unity Technologies or other companies. Thoughts/mistakes are my own.

I'm currently an Engineering Manager with Unity Technologies. I have a long background in AAA game development, having worked at Origin Systems / Electronic Arts, Sony Online Entertainment, Bioware / Electronic Arts, and Bethesda Game Studios / Zenimax Media.

Now that I work for Unity, I'm more free to engage with public communities and public source development, so I'm doing more hobby projects and contributing where I can. Realistically, I'll likely only make sporadic progress on projects here, but who knows.

My expected focus is simplifying quality-focused processes so that more developers will adopt practices such as:
- unit testing
- code coverage analysis
- static analysis
- linters
- branch protections
- required status checks on pull requests
- etc.

So, expect quality-focused project templates, tutorial, links to references, and basically anything to better package up good practices to make them sustainable and easily adoptable. Anyone can throw code into a Unity Update() call, but how easily can we make it to have confidence that it's TRULY correct?

### Professional Profile

This is my personal GitHub account, and is not associated with Unity Technologies or other companies. Thoughts/mistakes are my own.

I'm currently an Engineering Manager with Unity Technologies. I have a long background in AAA game development, having worked at Origin Systems / Electronic Arts, Sony Online Entertainment, Bioware / Electronic Arts, and Bethesda Game Studios / Zenimax Media.

Now that I work for Unity, I'm more free to engage with public communities and public source development, so I'm doing more hobby projects and contributing where I can. Realistically, I'll likely only make sporadic progress on projects here, but who knows.
